 	review2="Dr Hemanth is a wonderful detail oriented doctor. He was able to reconstruct my mother's entire eye history and put her treatment on the right part. He takes a holistic view including impact of general immunity,  sugar etc rather than hurrying with a diagnosis. We had a different experience than with past doctors. <br><br>I also needed help when I had an eye injury (sports) and felt confident about his care.<br><br>The facilities are good and new, with friendly support staff. Overall highly recommend."

They have done the surgery with utmost care. Especially Dr Hemant and Rizwan were very helpful, patient and supportive. The equipment and facilities are of high standards."
